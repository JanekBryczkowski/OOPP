# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project

Disclaimer: I was the leader of the project, however, the deadlines were strict, and thus the quality of the code is not the standard of code I would write myself.
